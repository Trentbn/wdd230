        <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
        <p>Apple</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.apple.com/">apple.com</a></p>
        <img
          src="images/rsz_applecom_iphone_12_pro.png"
          alt="Screenshot of apple.com homepage"
        />
        <p>
          Apple's website is a great example of applying the principle of "White
          Space and Clean Design". The hompage is not clutterd, / showing only a
          handful of elements with plenty of blank space arount them. This makes
          the page look very simple and clean, / drawing focus to only the few
          important elements on the site.

        <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
        <p>Headspace</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.headspace.com/">headspace.com</a></p>
        <img
          src="images/rsz_wwwheadspacecom_iphone_12_pro.png"
          alt="Screenshot of headspace.com homepage"
        />
        <p>
          Headspace's website does a great job of using visual heirarchy in
          their design. The first thing that catches our attention / is there
          product image and heading. The second thing we see is the call to
          action buttons, with their free trial in bold. / Third, we see the
          blue "Try for free button" in the top right. Their application of
          visual heirarchy draws your attention / to the main actions they want
          people to take on their site.

        <h3>Contrast</h3>
        <p>Hawthorne</p>
        <p><a href="https://hawthorne.co/">hawthorne.com</a></p>
        <img
          src="images/rsz_hawthorneco_iphone_12_pro_1.png"
          alt="Screenshot of hawthorne.com homepage"
        />
        <p>
          The principle of contrast being applied is evident throughout
          Hawthornes entire site. The text pops within the background / color,
          and sections are clearly differentiated with strong contrasting
          colors. The two call to action buttons in the / screenshot stand out
          thanks to the contrasting colors used.
